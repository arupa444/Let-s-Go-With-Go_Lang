# Let's Go With Go_Lang

This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly Go programming language examples. It's an excellent resource for anyone starting their journey with Go or for those who want to brush up on the fundamentals. Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a specific concept in Go.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

*   **goArray:** Contains examples of how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays.
*   **goFor:** Demonstrates the use of `for` loops for iteration.
*   **goFunc:** Includes examples of function definitions, parameters, and return values.
*   **goIfElse:** Shows how to use `if-else` statements for conditional logic.
*   **goMap:** Contains examples of using maps (Go's built-in hash table).
*   **goQuestions:** A collection of solved programming problems to practice your skills.
*   **goString:** Provides examples of string manipulation.
*   **goStruct:** Includes examples of how to define and use structs.
*   **goSwitch:** Demonstrates the use of `switch` statements.
*   **inventoryDetails:** A mini-project that applies the concepts learned.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started with these examples, you'll need to have Go installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/)

Once Go is installed, you can run any of the `.go` files using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# To initialize a new Go module and start managing your project's dependencies
go mod init <module_name>
go run <filename>.go
```

For example, to run the main.go file in the root directory, you would use:

```bash
go mod init startGoLLM
go run main.go
```
